# I_Williams_Python_Practice
These are projects for class and practice that I did with myself.
This was my final for the Python class I took last semster. It is a game called the Lo Shu Magic Square.


In this game you need to identify the correct sequence of numbers from 1-9 that makes each row, each column, and the diagonals 
of a 3x3 square that equal to '15' when you add them vertically, horizontally, and diagonally.
You can choose to enter the numbers individually or have a random set of numbers chosen for you.
